 # Brain Out - Cards
 
## Game Descriptions
A gauntlet of card puzzles that involve interactions with cards. Players have to complete tasks like clicking on the highest valued card, or move a bunch of cards into a box, etc. There are currently 10 levels planned. The game inspiration is coming from a mobile game application named 'Brain Out'. (available both in iOS and Android).

The API is used to randomly pick the cards from the deck. 

## Approaches Taken
My objective is to create a game that is simple but fun. To achieve that i also did some research on games within the scope of the unit 1.

## Game Instructions
Clear all 10 levels to win the game.
